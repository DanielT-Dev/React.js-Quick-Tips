# ⚙️ Speed up development with React.js + Vite.js bundling 🚀

 Vite.js is a fast, modern build tool for web development that aims to provide a better developer experience compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack or Parcel. 

### Simple setup:

To get started with Vite for a React project:

```bash
# Create a new project using Vite
npm create vite@latest my-vite-app -- --template react

# Navigate into your project
cd my-vite-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

After you create a Vite project and start the development server, you should see the following

```
VITE v4.0.0  ready in 500 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

### Done ! ⭐
